# Mice apocalypse

This is a mice population genetics simulation program I wrote in Java for my scientific computing class.

Helps to answer very interesting questions like:
1. How long does it take to reach Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium based on specific initial genotypic conditions

2. How will a mice population of x look like in n years if females were more attracted to males a particular genotype

3. How will a mice population of x look like in n years if a particular genotypic composition is lethal

etc
